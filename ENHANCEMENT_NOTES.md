# Portfolio Enhancement Changes

This document describes the recent enhancements made to your portfolio website.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed Favicon Issue
- **Problem**: Project pages were using `logo.ico` which caused the favicon to change when viewing project details
- **Solution**: Updated all project pages to use `erfan-avatar-circle.png` for consistent branding
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `projects/person-detection.html`
  - `projects/lean4-llm-agent.html`
  - `projects/project-template.html`
  - All new project pages

### 2. ✅ Standardized Project Image Sizes
- **Status**: Already implemented in existing CSS
- **How it works**: The CSS uses `object-fit: cover` on `.project-img img` which ensures all project thumbnails in the portfolio grid maintain consistent dimensions (200px height) regardless of original image aspect ratios
- **No changes needed**: The existing implementation already handles this correctly

### 3. ✅ Added Interactive Image Gallery with Lightbox
- **New Feature**: Click on any gallery image in project pages to open a full-screen lightbox viewer
- **Features**:
  - Click any gallery image to view in fullscreen
  - Navigate between images using:
    - Previous/Next buttons (< >)
    - Keyboard arrows (← →)
    - ESC key to close
  - Image counter shows current position (e.g., "2 / 3")
  - Click outside image or X button to close
  - Fully responsive for mobile devices
- **Files Added**:
  - `assets/js/lightbox.js` - JavaScript for lightbox functionality
  - Updated `assets/css/project-style.css` - Lightbox styles and responsive design
- **Gallery Sections Added To**:
  - All existing project pages
  - All new project pages (3 placeholder images each)

### 4. ✅ Added Telegram Social Link

<div class="gallery-grid">
  <img src="../assets/images/projects/[project-name]/screenshot1.jpg" alt="Description" class="gallery-image">
  <img src="../assets/images/projects/[project-name]/screenshot2.jpg" alt="Description" class="gallery-image">
  <img src="../assets/images/projects/[project-name]/screenshot3.jpg" alt="Description" class="gallery-image">
  <!-- Add more images here -->
</div>
```
