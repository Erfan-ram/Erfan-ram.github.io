Added classroom/teaching session images to the Teaching Assistant Experience section for each professor:

- **Dr. Mohammad Hamghalam** (Digital Systems and Design): Added `hamghalam.jpeg`

The gallery now displays a total of 12 images (5 new + 7 existing).

### 3. âœ… Reorganized Image Files
Moved all academic-related images from `assets/images/Recommendations/` to `assets/images/Gallery/` for better organization:
- Moved 7 academic research photos (174*.jpeg and 175*.jpeg files)
- Updated all image paths in `index.html` to point to the new Gallery location
- Removed the now-empty `Recommendations` directory

### 4. ðŸ“‹ Certificate Gallery - Images Not Found
The request mentioned adding "talkmasterpart" and "iranopen" images to the Certificate Gallery section. However, these image files do not exist in the repository. 

**Action Required**: The user needs to add these certificate images to the repository before they can be displayed.

## Gallery Directory Contents
The `assets/images/Gallery/` directory now contains 15 images:
- 5 new gallery images (gallery01-05)
- 7 academic research photos (moved from Recommendations)
- 3 professor/teaching session photos (hamghalam, shapouri, Saeed-Haji-Nasiri)

## Technical Details
- All gallery images use the existing `recommendations-gallery` CSS class for consistent styling
- Images are clickable and work with the existing lightbox functionality
- All 18 images in the Academic tab (including those in teaching sections) are accessible through the lightbox navigation
- No CSS or JavaScript changes were required - reused existing components

## Files Modified
- `index.html` - Updated Teaching Assistant sections and Academic & Research Gallery
- Moved 7 image files from `Recommendations/` to `Gallery/` directory
- Removed empty `Recommendations/` directory

## Testing
- âœ… Manually tested in browser
- âœ… Verified all images load correctly
- âœ… Confirmed lightbox functionality works for all gallery images
- âœ… Verified responsive layout (images adapt to grid layout)

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Add missing certificate images ("talkmasterpart" and "iranopen") when available
2. Consider adding more teaching session photos if available
3. Add more descriptive alt text to images for better accessibility
